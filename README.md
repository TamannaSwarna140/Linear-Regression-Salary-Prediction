# Linear-Regression-Salary-Prediction
It is a experimental Linear Regression Model to predict salary from years of experience of an employee. The Linear Regression-Salary dataset used in this experiment is popular dataset in Kaggle. Firstly, Salary is predicted using Linear Regression Math-Formula. Secondly, Sci-kit Learn model is used to predict Salary and compared with Math-Formula. Lastly, a prediction model is build where the dataset is splitted into train, and test data. The model is trained with train data, and tested/ predicted Salary using test data with accuracy score. Then evaluation metrics is also applied.
